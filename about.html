                <p>
                    I am a passionate and highly adaptable engineering professional. Whilst studying in RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) for my bachelor's degree in Advanced Manufacturing and Mechatronics. My passion on topics such as control systems, machine vision, embedded system development, and software development were improved with formal education. Whenever periods of extended holidays free up my schedule, I tend to develop projects. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Engineering aside, I enjoy playing badminton with friends weekly. I also weight lift and jog in the gymnasium multiple times a week as it helps clear my head. Feel free to have a look through my website, (my most recent project, JUN 23). I hope viewing my projects spark as much excitement as when I developed them.
