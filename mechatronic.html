                <h2>Objectives and Processes</h2>
                <p>
                    The project had several objectives aimed at designing and developing an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) to address the challenges faced by the manufacturing industry, particularly during the global pandemic. The main objectives were to create an AGV that could navigate autonomously, avoid obstacles, follow a predefined path, and turn tight corners within the factory environment. Additionally, the project sought to develop a prototype that could demonstrate the feasibility of the AGV concept and serve as a foundation for potential future development.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To achieve these objectives, the team followed a systematic process that encompassed research, planning, design, and implementation. The process began with a thorough exploration of existing AGV technologies and a review of relevant literature. This research phase helped the team gain a comprehensive understanding of the components, capabilities, and limitations of AGVs, as well as identify potential solutions for the project's requirements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Based on the research findings, the team formulated plans for the AGV design. Initially, Plan A involved constructing a full-sized AGV capable of pushing trolleys loaded with ceramic tiles. However, considering time limitations and the risk of incomplete development, the team decided to shift to Plan B, which involved creating a smaller-scale prototype AGV without load-bearing capabilities. This decision allowed the team to focus on demonstrating the key functionalities and proving the concept to Southern Cross Ceramics.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The design process involved iterating and refining the AGV's mechanical and electrical components. The team utilized Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software to develop the prototype's design, ensuring the integration of sensors, motors, and control systems. Material selection was a crucial consideration, and the team opted for 3D printed PLA plastic due to its suitability for the prototype's smaller scale and absence of load requirements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Implementation of the design involved assembling the prototype AGV and integrating the necessary hardware and software components. The team followed a structured work schedule, assigning tasks and responsibilities to team members. Regular meetings with the course coordinator and project supervisor facilitated progress tracking and provided guidance throughout the implementation phase.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Testing and fine-tuning were crucial stages of the project. The prototype AGV underwent rigorous testing to validate its autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and line following capabilities. The team identified and addressed issues such as shadow disruption on the line-following track, time delays during direction changes, and software bugs. By implementing solutions and refining the design and code, the team ensured that the prototype performed as intended.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout the project, risk assessment was conducted to identify potential risks and mitigate them accordingly. The team maintained effective communication channels with Southern Cross Ceramics to align the project's progress with their expectations. Feedback from the industrial partner was continuously sought and incorporated into the design and development process.

                    The prototype AGV showcased autonomous navigation capabilities, accurately following the predefined path marked by black tape on the factory floor. The RGB camera installed on the AGV effectively detected and tracked the tape, enabling precise line following. This feature proved crucial in ensuring the AGV's ability to maneuver through the factory environment without deviating from its intended path.
